Steps to Write SASS (SCSS syntax):
Install SASS
First, install the Sass tool on your computer or in your project using a package manager like npm.

Create Your Project Structure
Make folders for your SCSS files and a separate folder where the compiled CSS will go.

Write Your SCSS File
Create a .scss file and write your styles using variables, nesting, mixins, etc.

Compile SCSS to CSS
Use the Sass command to convert your .scss file into a regular .css file that browsers understand.

Link the CSS File to HTML
In your HTML, include the compiled CSS file.

Keep Editing and Compiling
As you make changes to your SCSS file, recompile it or use a watch mode to do it automatically.
